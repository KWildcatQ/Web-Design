                    <p style="color: blue; line-height: 1.5"> For our analysis of humidity in relation to latitude, we again looked at
                    humidity overall in addition to humidity in relation to latitude in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres. As can be 
                    seen on the left, there is little to no relation to latitude and humidity. This is most likely due to the fact that humidity
                    is itself a measure of liquid in the air. It must be noted that the areas close to the equator are known for having higher levels
                    of annual rainfall, and that the further North and South of the equator one travels; the greater likelihood to experience
                    extreme weather such as snow and extremely cold weather (such as that at either pole), with snow/ice also being related to humidity.
