                    <p style="color: blue; line-height: 1.5"> For our analysis of humidity in relation to latitude, the chart on the left is analyzing 
                     average wind speed (mph) in relation to distance from the equator. From this chart it appears that average windspeed is likely 
                    going to be between 0 mph and 25 mph on a given day. Keeping in mind that there are several high altitude slip streams that 
                    go specific ways that aviation uses...the distribution here is not surprisning and you can see that some of the windspeeds 
                    between 40 degrees and 65 to 70 degrees are quite excessive compared to the rest of the chart.
